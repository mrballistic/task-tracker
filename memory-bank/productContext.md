# Product Context: Task Tracker Application

## Problem Statement
People often struggle with managing their tasks efficiently, leading to missed deadlines, forgotten responsibilities, and increased stress. Without a dedicated system, important tasks may get lost among less critical ones, and prioritization becomes difficult.

## Solution
The Task Tracker application provides a dedicated system for users to:
- Record and track all their tasks in one place
- Categorize tasks for better organization
- Assign priority levels to focus on what matters most
- Track task status (TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE)
- Set due dates to manage time effectively

## Target User Experience
Users should be able to:
1. Quickly add new tasks with minimal friction
2. Easily view their tasks organized by different criteria (priority, status, category, due date)
3. Update task details and status with simple interactions
4. Get a clear overview of completed and pending tasks
5. Experience a consistent, responsive interface regardless of device
6. Choose between light and dark themes based on preference

## Key User Journeys
1. **Task Creation**: User adds a new task with title, description, priority, category, and due date
2. **Task Management**: User updates task status as they work through their list
3. **Task Organization**: User filters and sorts tasks to focus on specific priorities or categories
4. **Task Completion**: User marks tasks as done and can review completed tasks
