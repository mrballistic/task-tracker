- Task list UI components
- Task creation and edit forms
- Filtering and sorting capabilities
- Task status management
- Category management
- Priority level implementation
- Due date tracking
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Responsive design adjustments

## Current Status
Project is in the initial setup phase. The foundation has been laid with the basic project structure, database schema, and UI library configuration. Ready to begin implementation of core functionality.

## Known Issues
