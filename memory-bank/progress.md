# Progress: Task Tracker Application

## What Works
- Project initialization with Next.js and TypeScript
- Material UI setup with initial theme configuration
- Database schema defined in Prisma
- Project structure established
- Prisma client singleton created
- API routes for CRUD operations
- Task list UI components with filtering and sorting
- Task creation and edit forms
- Task status management UI
- Priority level implementation
- Due date tracking
- Dark/light mode toggle with theme persistence
- Dashboard page with task statistics and highlights

## What's Left to Build
- Category management improvements
- Task tagging system enhancements
- Additional filtering options
- Responsive design refinements
- Unit and integration tests
- Performance optimizations

## Current Status
Project has progressed from initial setup to having a functional UI. The core features are now implemented including task management, filtering, theme support, and a dashboard view. The application now supports all CRUD operations via the API and provides a complete interface for managing tasks.

## Known Issues
- Need to validate API calls in production environment
- Form validation could be enhanced
- Need to add proper error boundaries for error handling
